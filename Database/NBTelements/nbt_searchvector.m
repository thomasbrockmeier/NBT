% nbt_searchvector() - returns a vector with indices of elements in
% 'vector'
% that match the 'searchvector'
%
% Usage:
%   >>  positive = nbt_searchvector( vector, searchvector );
%
% Inputs:
%   vector     - vector which indices will be used
%   searchvector     - a vector with elements to match
%
% Outputs:
%   positive     - non-sorted vector of indices of elements in 'vector' that match elements
%   in 'searchvector'
%
% Example:
%nbt_searchvector([1 2 6 3 4 5], [1 2 6 4])
% will return; 1 2 3 5.
